        "abstract": "\n            Computer networks have become ubiquitous and integral part of the nation's critical infrastructure. How to grasp the real-time overall situation of the network security is very noteworthy to study. Current network security systems make great contributions in enhancing the network security. Nevertheless, these products are independent and autonomous, so they fail to share the results of the detected attacks. Consequently, such solutions cannot figure out an overview of the network security situation. In another perspective, building a new global monitoring system from scratch will suffer from redundant construction, more cost, and longer deploying time. To address the dilemma, we propose a novel solution called\n            <jats:italic>GS-TMS</jats:italic>\n            which reuses the log data generated by the existing widely-spread security systems. By introducing the data stream and data integration technologies, GS-TMS provides a desirable capability of quickly building a large-scale distributed network monitoring system. Furthermore, GS-TMS has additional notable advantages over current monitoring systems in scalability and flexibility.\n          "

The anatomical target is typically primary motor cortex since motor evoked potentials (MEPs) before and after the intervention can be used to assess effects of the respective rTMS protocol. High-frequency regular rTMS and intermittent TBS protocols tend to increase corticospinal excitability as indexed by MEP amplitude, whereas low-frequency regular rTMS and continuous TBS protocols tend to reduce corticospinal excitability. These effects are primarily due to LTP-like and LTD-like synaptic changes mediated by GABA and NMDA receptors. Changes in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cortical microcircuits play a secondary role, with inconsistent effects as determined by paired-pulse TMS protocols. Finally, the challenge of large inter-subject response variability, and current directions of research to optimize rTMS effects through EEG-dependent personalized TMS are discussed."

        "abstract": "This article reviews several protocols of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)-induced plasticity. rTMS, when applied to the motor cortex or other cortical regions of the brain, may induce effects that outlast the stimulation period. The neural plasticity, which emerges as a result of such interventions, has been studied to gain insight into plasticity mechanisms of the brain. In two protocols the structure of rTMS trains is modified, informed by the knowledge of the physiological properties of the corticospinal system. Pulse configuration, stimulus frequency, stimulus intensity, the duration of the application period, and the total number of stimuli are some variables that have to be taken into account when reviewing the physiological effects of rTMS. This article also introduces the concept of patterned rTMS pulses and rTMS with ischemic nerve block. In addition, rTMS has raised considerable interest because of its therapeutic potential; however, much needs to be done in this field."

        "abstract": "Few clinical investigations show that repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the brain could produce analgesia. Apart from the relationship between TMS and pain with respect to the clinical observation of rTMS-induced analgesic effects, this article also reviews the effects of pain on motor cortex excitability assessed by single or paired-pulse TMS and the results obtained by applying peripheral magnetic stimulation to treat musculoskeletal pain. This article discusses the effects of acute phasic provoked pain, and prolonged tonic provoked pain on motor cortex excitability. The analgesic effects resulting from a single session of rTMS are too short-lived and thereby incompatible with a durable control of chronic pain. Repeated sessions of rTMS on consecutive days produce cumulative effects. However, repeated daily rTMS sessions can be applied to control pain syndromes for a limited period. Further work is needed to define the ultimate clinical role of TMS in the management of pain."

        "abstract": "Traumatic events pose great challenges on mental health services in scarcity of specialist trauma clinicians and services. Simple short screening instruments for detecting adverse psychological responses are needed. Several brief screening instruments have been developed. However, some are limited, especially in relation to reflecting the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis. Recently, several studies have challenged pre-existing ideas about PTSD’s latent structure. Factor analytic research currently supports two four factor models. One particular model contains a dysphoria factor which has been associated with depression and anxiety. The symptoms in this factor have been hailed as less specific to PTSD. The scope of this article is therefore to present a short screening instrument, based on this research; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) – 8 items. The PTSD-8 is shown to have good psychometric properties in three independent samples of whiplash patients (n=1710), rape victims (n=305), and disaster victims (n=516). Good test-rest reliability is also shown in a pilot study of young adults from families with alcohol problems (n=56)."

        "abstract": "The simplest transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coil is a circular one. The induced current is maximum near the outer edge of the coil while the magnetic field is the maximum under the center of the coil. TMS coils have good penetration to the cerebral cortex. They are commonly placed at the cranial vertex, where they can stimulate both hemispheres simultaneously. The main drawback of circular coils is their lack of focality. Several complex designs for multiloop coils have been proposed to increase the focality or improve the penetration to deep brain structures. This article describes factors of TMS coil design such as mechanical forces and coil lead wires, cooling systems, materials of construction of coil windings, etc. To reduce the risk of lethal electrical shock the entire high-voltage power system, including the lead wires and stimulation coil, must be isolated from earth ground."

        "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulators have progressed from basic implementations to integrated systems optimized for treatment of pathologies. This article reviews key factors of design of such clinically targeted systems, discussing design principles, procedure-specific features, and clinical safety requirements. A power source, a capacitor, and a high-power switch controlled by a processor form the basic stimulator. The fundamental operating mechanism of a TMS stimulator is to create a changing magnetic field that can induce a current in adjacent conductive material. The clinical TMS system must incorporate patient positioning, patient comfort, coil positioning features, and intuitive user controls and means of managing patient data to be a fully effective system. The most important safety risk with repetitive TMS reported in the literature is the risk of inducing seizure. Other safety considerations include proper use of human factor analysis to minimize improper operation, the biocompatibility of materials touching the patient, and addressing acoustic noise."

        "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to search for cortical dysfunction in migraine. Both, the motor and the visual cortices have been explored in this area. This article reviews and discusses the results of the various studies performed in migraine patients with TMS of motor or visual cortices. The majority of evoked and event-related potential studies in migraine have shown two abnormalities: increased amplitude of grand averaged responses and lack of habituation in successive blocks of averaged responses with decreased amplitude in the first block. These abnormalities suggest that the excitability state of the cerebral cortex, particularly of the visual cortex, is abnormal in migraineurs between attacks. The use of TMS to assess motor and visual cortex excitability has yielded conflicting results, which could be due to methodological differences. Taken together, all studies indicate that the changes in cortical reactivity are more complex in migraineurs than initially thought and suggest that both larger multidisciplinary studies and focused analyses of subgroups of patients with more refined clinical phenotypes are necessary to disentangle the role of the cerebral cortex in migraine pathophysiology."

        "abstract": "What is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and who experiences it? Why do some people develop PTSD after a traumatic event, while others do not? What are the unique impacts of trauma on children? Are there effective treatments for traumatic stress disorders? PTSD: What Everyone Needs to Know is a scientifically-supported yet accessible resource on a disorder that affects up to 7% of adults during their lifetime. Utilizing a reader-friendly Q&amp;A format, the book demystifies and defines PTSD, explaining that, despite popular opinion and countless media portrayals, this is not simply a disorder for combat veterans. Instead, survivors of any life-threatening event can experience PTSD. Beginning with an overview of common types of trauma, internationally-renowned experts on traumatic stress Barbara Rothbaum and Sheila Rauch then go on to describe the effects of PTSD, what can trigger the disorder, and who is likely to experience it. They explain how the most effective treatments work, and guide readers on how to be a source of support and understanding for those who have experienced trauma. Drawing attention to the pervasiveness of traumatic experiences in our lives and in culture and society, PTSD: What Everyone Needs to Know is a must-read for anyone seeking authoritative and current information about this often misunderstood disorder."

        "abstract": "This article introduces the relationship between mathematical cognition and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The mental number line is located in the parietal lobe. Studies employing TMS have explored issues related to the mental number line. This article reviews the studies centered on the magnitude code. The results show that even though the parietal activation is nearly always present in both hemispheres, it is often asymmetric, being greater in the right hemisphere when quantification of nonverbal and nonsymbolic material is required. Neuropsychological studies confirm the relation between the magnitude code and the parietal lobe. The extent to which number-related processes are number specific, and the extent to which they overlap with other aspects of spatial or magnitude representation, is currently a burgeoning area of research. Current work is aimed to disrupt numerical processes and observe concomitant changes in brain activation."

Non pas que, en l’occurrence, l’approche biomécanique ait perdu toute légitimité, mais parce que l’efficacité de la prévention demande un changement de périmètre de l’intervention qui fait de la gestion et du management, non plus des éléments de contexte, mais la matière même de l’intervention. L’expérience de l’ergonomie en matière de prévention des TMS, l’a en effet progressivement convaincue de la pertinence de relier le modèle pathologique des TMS au modèle de gestion taylorien qui inspire encore les organisations concernées. D’où l’enjeu pour l’ergonomie, de mobiliser le modèle de l’activité pour relier modèles de prévention des risques et modèles de valorisation – économique et subjective – du travail. A condition évidemment, de procéder elle-même à un repositionnement de sa propre compréhension de ce qu’elle appelle « activité »."

A wide array of pharmacological treatments is available, but they have often been proven to be ineffective in ameliorating disease symptomatology or slowing disease progress. As such, non-invasive and non-pharmacological techniques have been gaining more ground. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) utilizes the electric field generated by a magnetic coil to stimulate neurons and has been applied, usually paired with electroencephalography, to study the underlying pathophysiology of MS, and in repetitive trains, in the form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), to induce long-lasting changes in neuronal circuits. In this review, we present the available literature on the application of TMS and rTMS in the context of MS, with an emphasis on its therapeutic potential on various clinical aspects, while also naming the ongoing trials, whose results are anticipated in the future."

Navigated TMS (nTMS) is used increasingly to identify the functional motor area of different muscles for clinical applications, including neurosurgical planning. However, the accuracy of TMS-based mapping of functional motor areas may depend on the TMS-induced current direction due to anisotropic cortical morphology, complicating association of the functional motor maps with neuroanatomical structures. Furthermore, it is not clear how well nTMS can distinguish nearby muscle representations on the cortical surface. We therefore investigated the functional motor maps obtained with posterior-to-anterior (PA) and lateral-to-medial (LM) TMS-induced currents within a spatially defined area by stimulating targets in a grid of locations over the left primary motor cortex in 8 healthy participants. Results were compared to functional MRI (fMRI) activation maps obtained using a voluntary opposing thumb movement task. We found that TMS applied with PA-induced currents identifies a motor area that is located significantly more anterior (8.7 – 10.4 mm depending on the muscle) with respect to an MEP motor area identified using LM-induced currents for the same muscle. Motor maps obtained with LM-induced currents show more overlap with the motor map identified using fMRI compared to PA-induced currents. In conclusion, the spatial representation of the MEP motor map identified by TMS is dependent on the direction of the induced current. These findings suggest that the application of nTMS using an LM-induced current direction corresponds best with the hand motor area as measured with fMRI."

The phase of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal predicts performance in motor, somatosensory, and cognitive functions. Studies suggest that brain phase resets align neural oscillations with external stimuli, or couple oscillations across frequency bands and brain regions. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) can cause phase resets noninvasively in the cortex, thus providing the potential to control phase-sensitive cognitive functions. However, the relationship between TMS parameters and phase resetting is not fully understood. This is especially true of TMS intensity, which may be crucial to enabling precise control over the amount of phase resetting that is induced. Additionally, TMS phase resetting may interact with the instantaneous phase of the brain. Understanding these relationships is crucial to the development of more powerful and controllable stimulation protocols. <jats:italic>Approach.</jats:italic> To test these relationships, we conducted a TMS-EEG study. We applied single-pulse TMS at varying degrees of stimulation intensity to the motor area in an open loop. Offline, we used an autoregressive algorithm to estimate the phase of the intrinsic <jats:italic>µ</jats:italic>-Alpha rhythm of the motor cortex at the moment each TMS pulse was delivered. <jats:italic>Main results</jats:italic>. We identified post-stimulation epochs where <jats:italic>µ</jats:italic>-Alpha phase resetting and N100 amplitude depend parametrically on TMS intensity and are significant <jats:italic>versus</jats:italic> peripheral auditory sham stimulation. We observed <jats:italic>µ</jats:italic>-Alpha phase inversion after stimulations near peaks but not troughs in the endogenous <jats:italic>µ</jats:italic>-Alpha rhythm. <jats:italic>Significance</jats:italic>. These data suggest that low-intensity TMS primarily resets existing oscillations, while at higher intensities TMS may activate previously silent neurons, but only when endogenous oscillations are near the peak phase. These data can guide future studies that seek to induce phase resetting, and point to a way to manipulate the phase resetting effect of TMS by varying only the timing of the pulse with respect to ongoing brain activity."

The primary indication for antipsychotic medications is the treatment of psychotic disorders and mania, even in the absence of psychosis. The more troublesome side effects of antipsychotic medications include increased appetite and weight gain; extrapyramidal side effects, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Antidepressants are effective for treating depressive illness, including major depression, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. They are also often used effectively in the treatment of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, and somatic symptom disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally well tolerated. Other important categories of medications include mood stabilizers and anxiolytics."

Conventional treatments for mTBI/PTSD symptoms have limited efficacy and are associated with undesirable side effects.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the force/torque control strategy for the robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) system, considering the shape of the TMS coil case. Hybrid position/force control is used to compensate for the error between the current and target position of the coil and to maintain the contact between the coil and the subject’s head. The desired force magnitude of the force control part of the hybrid controller is scheduled by the error between the current and target position of the TMS coil for fast error reduction and the comfort of the subject. Additionally, the torque proportional to the torque acting on the coil’s center is generated to stabilize the contact. Compliance control, which makes the robot adaptive to the environment, stabilizes the coil and head interaction during force/torque control. The experimental results showed that the force controller made the coil generate a relatively large force for a short time (less than 10 s) for the fast error reduction, and a relatively small interaction force was maintained for the contact. They showed that the torque controller made the contact area inside the coil. The experiment also showed that the proposed strategy could be used for tracking a new target point estimated by the neuronavigation system when the head moved slightly."

        "abstract": "In addition to the core posttraumatic symptomatology such as s trauma-related intrusions, avoidance, and hyperarousal, patients with complex PTSD related to childhood abuse often also exhibit distortions of emotion regulation, pervasive negative self-concepts, and difficult interpersonal relationships. DBT-PTSD is a comprehensive multicomponent treatment to specifically focus on the sequelae of childhood abuse with and without borderline personality disorder. Based on the principles of DBT, it adds trauma-specific cognitive and skills-assisted exposure-based techniques and interventions to improve acceptance as well as compassion for self and others. It has been developed for and tested in both a three-month residential treatment and a 12-month outpatient programme. The first randomized controlled trial evaluated the treatment under residential conditions, including borderline patients with ongoing self harm. The second large multi-centre trial investigates DBT-PTSD under outpatient conditions, compared to Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT). This chapter reviews the principles and structure of this new and highly promising DBT-adaptation."

The focus of this article is aspects of consciousness, i.e. being aware or unaware, and their cerebral basis. TMS has been used to demonstrate regional cortical functional specialization. The reasons for the effects caused by TMS are still not fully known. Further work must be done in order to address this problem. TMS can briefly impose (or disrupt) rhythmic discharge in the underlying cortex and some of these rhythms are thought to be important for selective attention and awareness. TMS can disrupt activity in underlying brain tissue with millisecond precision but thus far it is usually used in isolation. When combined with event-related potentials and functional magnetic resonance imaging its usefulness will expand."

By offering an alternative to surgery or medication, TMS could significantly enhance patient outcomes and quality of life, particularly for those with conditions resistant to traditional therapies. With ongoing research advancements, TMS may become a cornerstone of personalized medicine, enabling treatments tailored to individual brain patterns and needs. Although rTMS has FDA approval and dTMS has clearance for treating treatment-resistant depression (TRD), comparative studies between these techniques remain scarce. This systematic review aims to assess and compare the efficacy of rTMS and dTMS in TRD through the analysis of observational studies and clinical trials that directly compare these two treatments. Relevant literature was identified through searches in Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Open Gray, covering studies published in English from 2014 to 2024. Only three studies, including one observational study and two RCTs, met inclusion criteria, indicating similar efficacy and safety for both techniques. This review highlights that both rTMS and dTMS are effective and safe for treating TRD, with no significant differences in symptom remission. However, dTMS is significantly more expensive, making rTMS a more viable option in resource-limited settings. The review underscores the need for further multicenter and long-term studies to better clarify the cost-effectiveness of these treatments."

Humans process this wealth of socially relevant information in a network of face-selective regions distributed across the brain. In this chapter I review studies that have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study the cognitive operations and functional connections of this network. TMS has disrupted brain areas contributing to the processing of facial identity, facial expression, eye-gaze direction, head direction, trustworthiness and the auditory-visual integration of speech. TMS can also be combined with neuroimaging techniques to study how transient focal disruption of a targeted face area impacts connections across the extended face network. I also review chronometric TMS studies that have established when faces are processed across different brain areas down to a millisecond resolution."

This article reviews the findings of such applications in patients with Parkinson's disease, dystonia, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, and essential tremor. The findings related to Parkinson's disease are characterized by a shortening of the cortical silence period (cSP), a reduction of short intracortical inhibition, an increase in the long-lasting intracortical inhibition, and a reduction of the normal motor evoked potential facilitation after single and repetitive TMS stimuli. Studies with paired-pulse TMS have provided controversial information on cortical motor excitability in Huntington's disease. The findings in dystonia include: a reduction of the short intracortical inhibition and a shortening of the cSP. In Tourette's syndrome patients, the cSP is short and intracortical inhibition is decreased. Patients with essential tremor have normal corticospinal conduction, normal duration of the cSP, and normal intracortical inhibition. Such application of TMS has produced enormous data and continues to do so."

Studies of TMS in depression and normal volunteers suggested lateral specificity of TMS-induced mood effects. Clinical trials to compare left versus right prefrontal TMS in mania have been developed. Studies to understand the effect of TMS in bipolar depression have been undertaken. The results show efficacy similar to that for unipolar depression. But this does not provide support for the concept of TMS as an anti-bipolar, or mood-stabilizing, treatment. The utility of TMS as prophylaxis for subsequent manic or depressive episodes has not been reported in bipolar disorder. More work is needed to clarify the risk of mood switch, and the potential of TMS as prophylaxis against future manic or depressive episodes."

The field of family violence has gained much from the field of traumatic stress, and collaborations between these two previously separate fields have yielded important new answers, as well as new research questions. The field of traumatic stress is poised to integrate, more fully than in the past, a variety of aspects of trauma such as social betrayal, as well as outcomes of trauma such as depression, criminality, and physiological harm that go beyond posttraumatic stress. The field of family violence has much to offer in this process. We look forward to improved research designs that will further our knowledge of how trauma affects aspects of people’s lives, including productivity, relationships, cognition, and emotions, in negative and positive ways.

Evidence from animal models suggests that many of the behavioural sequelae associated with visual neglect may result not solely from the size of the lesion, but also from a pathological state of increased inhibition exerted on the damaged hemisphere by the contralesional hemisphere. On the basis of these potential mechanisms underlying neglect, in this review we discuss therapeutic approaches, focusing particularly on recent research using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This technique, besides representing an ideal tool to investigate visuo‐spatial attentive mechanisms in humans, has shown promising beneficial effects that might have an impact on clinical practice."

Since it is possible to discuss the new aspects of the disease which consists on: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and - as a new disease - Complex PTSD (cPTSD).  The text is showing on the accuracy to make distinctions of the Complex PTSD from other known disease entities, because modern studies are clearly demonstrating this need. This is evidenced by studies of people exposed to chronic social stress combined with depression relationships. The experiences referred to as \"boundary\" for the human psyche and making up this type of disorder are long-lasting and leaving significant traces in the psyche of the patients (affective dysregulation).\n\nThe introduction of a new disease entity is caused by the necessity to adjust clinical diagnoses to new observations, which significantly beyond the accepted definition of PTSD (range: symptoms, treatment time). It seems legitimate to define a new comprehensive trauma; the symptoms largely depend on the characteristics of the individual patient."

With this approach, it is possible to demonstrate that TMS-EMG measures reflect axonal, or excitatory or inhibitory synaptic excitability in distinct interneuron circuits. On the other hand, the array of pharmaco-physiologically well-characterized TMS-EMG measures can be employed to study the effects of a drug with unknown or multiple modes of action, and hence to determine its main mode of action at the systems level of the motor cortex. Acute drug effects may be rather different from chronic drug effects, and these differences can also be studied in TMS experiments. Moreover, TMS or repetitive TMS (rTMS) may induce changes in endogenous neurotransmitter or neuromodulator systems. This offers the opportunity to study neurotransmission along defined neuronal projections. Finally, more recently, TMS-evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) responses have been developed to study cortical excitability and connectivity. Pharmaco-physiological testing can be employed to also characterize these TMS-EEG measures. All these aspects of the pharmacology of TMS measures in healthy subjects will be reviewed in this chapter."

Humans process this wealth of socially relevant information in a network of face-selective regions distributed across the brain. This chapter reviews studies that have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study the cognitive operations and functional connections of the face network. TMS has been used to disrupt brain areas contributing to the processing of facial identity, facial expression, eye-gaze direction, head direction, trustworthiness, and the auditory-visual integration of speech. TMS has also been combined with neuroimaging to map how transient disruption of a targeted face area impacts connectivity across the face network. I also review chronometric TMS studies that have established when faces are processed across different brain areas down to a millisecond resolution."

        "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is becoming an increasingly important tool for investigating the neurological basis of language. This article reviews the history of language studies that span a range of TMS methodologies. TMS offers a powerful tool for investigating the effects of brain damage. It answers questions of recovery mechanisms and methods to improve outcomes. In language studies, the most commonly used form of TMS is to generate ‘virtual patients’ by temporarily disrupting cortical processing. This article explains how TMS studies not only confirm but also clarify the specific regional contributions to semantic and phonological processing. There has been little work with regard to the role of TMS in the area of neurobiology of reading and reading disorders. The number of existing TMS techniques have not been applied to language, despite their obvious potential but this field is bound to grow in the field of language research."

However, proposals concerning the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive enhancement often rely on simplified notions of excitation and, most applications examining the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on functional neuroimaging measures have been limited to univariate analyses of brain activity. We present here analyses using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) analysis in order to quantify the effect of TMS on memory representations. To test whether an increase in local excitability in PFC can have measurable influences on upstream representations in earlier temporal memory regions, we compared 1Hz and 5Hz stimulation to the left dorsolateral PFC. We found that 10 minutes of 5Hz rTMS, relative to 1Hz, had multiple effects on neural representations: 1) greater RSA during both encoding and retrieval, 2) greater ERS across all items, and, critically, 3) increasing ERS in MTL with increasing univariate activity in DLPFC, and greater functional connectivity for hits than misses between these regions. These results provide the first evidence of rTMS enhancing semantic representations and strengthen the idea that rTMS may affect the reinstatement of previously experienced events in upstream regions."

For single pulse TMS these factors have been shown to influence, for example, motor threshold and recruitment curve, motor-evoked potential latency and silent period duration detected by motor cortex stimulation, and phosphene threshold tested by occipital stimulation. The mechanisms of most of these effects are understood from biophysical models and derive largely from the depolarization characteristics of cortical axon membranes. In contrast, in paired-pulse and repetitive TMS (rTMS) protocols, the complexity of the effects increases dramatically since they are mediated not only by the direct recruitment of various neuronal populations but also by recurrent network interactions and synaptic plasticity. Indeed, experimental studies have shown that the inhibition and facilitation induced by rTMS—a basis of therapeutic applications—are sensitive to the characteristics of the individual pulses as well as the pulse trains. A major challenge and opportunity is to expand and leverage the understanding of pulse waveform and direction effects to implement more potent and reliable rTMS interventions."

This article gives an overview of the changes that occur in motor function, as children get older and those aspects of central nervous development which may form the neural substrates of motor function development. It describes those TMS evoked parameters, related to the motor system, that have been studied in both typically developing children and in those who have suffered perinatal insults to the central nervous system. TMS has its limitations and is especially useful when used in combination with other neurophysiological modalities. The focus for future studies should be on correlating TMS evoked parameters with behavioural measures in typically developing children and explanation of the neural substrates of the motor abnormalities in children with perinatal insults and developmental disabilities."

It first considers research using TMS to create “virtual lesions” in targeted brain areas, with the goal of establishing the causal role, and sometimes the timing, of the targeted area in specific working memory component processes. Next, it highlights research adopting a “perturb-and-measure” approach, in which TMS is used in conjunction with simultaneous neural recording (e.g., functional MRI or EEG) to assess the role of brain excitability and inter-area connectivity in working memory. Finally, research using TMS to assess the role of neural oscillations in working memory is reviewed. Throughout, the chapter highlights how different TMS modalities can be used profitably to clarify the neural bases of working memory and to effect strong tests of predictions derived from psychological models."

Instead of providing meaningful jobs, access to quality health care and education, and fair and equitable housing, veterans learn that when their military service is done, they are now fighting a new battle – a failed bureaucracy which has let them and other veterans down for the past 100 years.</p>\n          <p>It’s not as if we as a nation haven’t tried. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has seen the largest increase in funding in its history and has been given several free passes when the budget axe arrives. Federal funding and grants for education have also enjoyed similar financial favor; and housing opportunities have been increased. Yet on a rudimentary level, we as a nation cannot stop believing that GI Joe and Jane can’t wait to come back home and pick up right where they left off before their military service began. The truth is, that person is gone and is not coming back. After months or years in a highly structured organizational environment, often times with deployments and horrific battlefield experiences, the military veteran has undergone a paradigm shift in their thinking, their character, and in the way they view themselves and others. </p>\n          <p>Advances in medical triage and transport have saved thousands of men and women who in previous wars who would have died on the battlefield; and new prosthetics and treatment strategies for those with “invisible wounds” have helped many. But an overburdened VHA isn’t prepared to provide for the sheer volumes of veterans that return home. And with veteran unemployment rates traditionally running percentage points higher than their civilian counterparts, America still wonders why. </p>\n          <p>Many veterans, particularly those with PTSD are lost when returning home. Moving Past PTSD: Consciousness, Understanding, and Appreciation for Military Veterans and Their Families hopes to break this cycle. In their own words, veterans, caregivers, and the family members that love them are given the opportunity to tell us what is truly broken in the military to civilian transition.  Advances in clinical treatments, the presentation of a new fast track job training program and new awareness for the challenges facing all military veterans, changes our way of understanding of who the 21st century veteran is. Through this understanding, we can change their lives and they can change ours."

The article reviews the use of TMS for monitoring the functional integrity of the descending motor systems during surgery and discusses the potential role of TMS in the preoperative period for conscious patients planning to undergo neurosurgical procedures involving the cerebral cortex. Selective monitoring of spinal cord motor function involves acquisition of TMS-induced epidural and/or myogenic responses. As patients are generally given anesthesia before spinal cord surgeries, this article discusses the effect of general anesthetic agents on the myogenic responses."

The magnetic fields applied to the scalp in both nonconvulsive and convulsive magnetic methods induce electrical current to flow in the brain, and it is that current that has therapeutic properties; viewed in this way, there is no inherent difference between electrical and magnetic brain stimulation methods in psychiatry. Indeed, attempts to induce seizures in monkeys via magnetic fields were only successful when the intracerebral peak voltage levels induced matched those recorded during the conventional application of electric current for ECS (Lisanby et al., 2001a).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>There are important practical differences between the methods, however, the most striking of which is that the skull, which deflects at least 90% of applied electrical current, is entirely transparent to magnetic fields. Thus, any “blurring” effects that might be attributable to skull impedance during electrical stimulation simply do not occur with magnetic fields, allowing for far more accurate focusing on the desired site of cortical stimulation with magnetic, as compared with electrical, methods."

However, the neural bases of such apparent interhemispheric influences from TMS remain unknown. Here, we studied this directly by combining TMS with concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We applied bursts of 10 Hz TMS over right parietal cortex, at a high or low intensity, during two sensory contexts: either without any other stimulation, or while participants received median nerve stimulation to the right wrist, which projects to left primary somatosensory cortex (SI). TMS to right parietal cortex affected the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in left SI, with high- versus low-intensity TMS increasing the left SI signal during right-wrist somatosensory input, but decreasing this in the absence of somatosensory input. This state-dependent modulation of SI by parietal TMS over the other hemisphere was accompanied by a related pattern of TMS-induced influences in the thalamus, as revealed by region-of-interest analyses. A behavioral experiment confirmed that the same right parietal TMS protocol of 10 Hz bursts led to enhanced detection of perithreshold electrical stimulation of the right median nerve, which is initially processed in left SI. Our results confirm directly that TMS over right parietal cortex can affect processing in left SI of the other hemisphere, with rivalrous effects (possibly transcallosal) arising in the absence of somatosensory input, but facilitatory effects (possibly involving thalamic circuitry) in the presence of driving somatosensory input."

Specific agents reviewed include: antidepressants, antiadrenergic agents, glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants, D-cycloserine, benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics. The empirical evidence indicates that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors can be considered first line medications for PTSD. It also indicates that neither atypical antipsychotic agents nor benzodiazepines can be recommended at this time. Combined approaches are also reviewed in which pharmacotherapy is combined with psychotherapy or other medications. Important gaps in current knowledge are also considered.It is clear that pharmacotherapy remains an important clinical option because medications are effective; they are often useful for treating comorbid depression and other anxiety disorders; they are generally wellaccepted by patients; and, finally the availability of prescribing clinicians is much greater than the availability of qualified psychotherapists."

Morbidity may involve the classic symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder such as a readiness to re-experience the psychological and physiological effects of trauma exposure, autonomic arousal, somatic ills and subsequent avoidant behavior as well as a host of other psychological morbidities such as depression, mood dysregulation and other internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Multimodal treatment approaches implementing family and social supports, psychoeducation, and cognitive behavioral techniques have the strongest evidence base. Psychopharmacologic interventions are not generally used, but may be necessary as an adjunct to other interventions for children with severe reactions or coexisting psychiatric conditions."

        "abstract": "This article introduces the difference between biphasic and monophasic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Waveform and current direction determine the effectiveness of TMS in humans. The alternating use of mono and biphasic pulses as conditioning or test pulse has so far not been possible. Since pulses of different waveform or orientation cannot be applied through the same coil at an interval in the millisecond range, using two different coils could be a feasible approach. This article brings in the concept of repetitive TMS (rTMS). Although clinical relevance is lacking, there is plenty of interesting data available for rTMS. Both pulse configuration and current direction affect the modulation of corticospinal excitability induced by rTMS. The effects during rTMS may differ from those outlasting rTMS. Further studies are needed to confirm the histological and physiological basis for these differences, and to clarify their clinical relevance."

The first is characterizing dysregulations of arousal that manifest in relation to sleep including disturbances of sleep initiation, maintenance, and depth. The other is characterizing nightmare disturbances in PTSD and establishing the role of the neurophysiological substrate of dreams, rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), in the disorder. While there has been uncertainty and controversy regarding these issues, a comprehensive look at findings and their context (e.g. duration of PTSD, setting of recordings) allows some reconciliation of findings. Recent developments include assessment of autonomic balance during sleep and application of functional brain imaging. Emerging research on the role of sleep, particularly REMS, on emotional learning has been linked to PTSD. Treatments specifically targeting nightmares and other sleep disruptions, such as the alpha adrenergic antagonist prazosin and imagery rehearsal therapy, continue to be developed and evaluated."

        "abstract": "Initial studies on the neuroendocrine basis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) showed a biological dysregulation of stress response systems that appeared to be incompatible with the stress response theories that had prevailed when PTSD was first established as a diagnosis. Cortisol levels were found to be lower and catecholamine higher in patients with PTSD than in those with major depression and other psychiatric disorders. There was no explanation for why levels of two stress hormones that are generally correlated—cortisol and norepinephrine—would be different, and it was also not clear why cortisol levels would be on the low end of the normal spectrum, when the classic stress response paradigms suggested stress results in elevated cortisol. The study of neuroendocrinology and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis alterations in PTSD provides an object lesson in how paradoxical observations might be pursued toward a better understanding of the pathophysiology of a disorder. This chapter reviews HPA findings in PTSD in cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal studies."

However, the mechanisms of risk and resilience following trauma exposure are not yet well understood, suggesting that investigations into the genetic architecture of PTSD have much to contribute. This chapter reviews the rapidly growing literature on molecular genetic risk factors for PTSD, including findings from candidate gene and genome-wide association studies. Given the critical role of trauma exposure in the onset of PTSD, it also discusses gene-environment interplay, and highlights some recent findings from epigenetic studies. The chapter concludes by summarizing considerations for the field as it continues to move forward, and discusses exciting new developments in the search for genetic markers for PTSD."

This chapter reviews classes of medications used as monotherapy and augmentation agents and evidence for their use. Antidepressant medications, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have the greatest body of evidence to support their use in treatment of PTSD, but the benefit they offer is modest, and they are ineffective in some populations. This chapter also reviews novel pharmacologic approaches to treatment of PTSD still under investigation. Beyond sleep, studies to date have not identified strategies to target specific symptom clusters in PTSD. Such studies may help tailor future treatment to symptoms that are either particularly disabling or refractory to other medications of psychosocial intervention. “Repurposing” studies of older agents originally approved for other illnesses may prove effective for specific symptoms or symptom clusters of PTSD."

A wide variety of PTSD treatment approaches have been applied with differing results regarding mitigation of symptoms and the duration of the mitigation. Authoritative sources from the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia identity specific psychotherapies as the “gold standard” for treatment. Despite warnings, patients have been prescribed pharmacological remedies. In the United States only two drugs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for PTSD treatment. However, a wider array of drugs has been prescribed. The US Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) specifically concluded that benzodiazepines use is not a recommended strategy for PTSD treatment, yet it is dispensed to veterans, although at a more limited rate than previously. Knowledge about relative effectiveness of alternative treatments is still emerging. As indicated by changes in US guidelines, the conventional wisdom regarding PTSD treatment is fluid and in need of periodic reassessment. Research on new types of treatment should be ongoing."

Three common PTSD scales were administered to 122 undergraduates who had experienced an emotionally salient, nontraumatic event: a college examination. Results indicated that normal levels of anxiety associated with the examination were positively correlated with scores on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Revised Civilian Mississippi Scale, and PTSD Checklist-CivilianVersion. Multiple regression analyses indicated that substantial variance in the PTSD scales was accounted for by trait characteristics such as negative and positive affectivity and affect intensity (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> .29 to .53). Negative affectivity correlated as highly with PTSD measures (r = .46 to .71) as those measures correlated with each other (r = .48 to .65). A high proportion of participants exceeded clinical cutoffs on these measures. The findings suggest that these PTSD scales may be overly sensitive to nontraumatic stressors such as everyday distress and trait characteristics. "

Prevalence rates suggest that women are especially vulnerable to developing PTSD. Despite changes in diagnostic criteria and examination across varied populations, the prevalence of PTSD remains consistently twice as high in women as men. This chapter examines sex differences in both incidence and presentation of PTSD. It then moves to a discussion of the neurobiological factors of PTSD in women, further examining stress and fear regulation mechanisms and the circuitry that may underlie the disproportionate vulnerability to PTSD development in women. The influence of gonadal hormones on PTSD symptomology is also explored in this chapter with a focus on estrogen and progesterone."

        "abstract": "It is generally accepted that women are at greater risk of lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than men. Both gender differences in trauma exposures and cognitive response to trauma as well as sex differences in neuroendocrine function are thought to contribute to the differences in prevalence of PTSD across the lifespan. For women, reproductive transitions such as puberty, pregnancy, and menopause are particularly relevant, as ovarian and stress hormones as well as neurosteroids exert profound effects on the central nervous system. Similarly, pregnancy and childbirth can be experienced as traumatic events leading to exacerbation or new-onset PTSD. This chapter reviews the relevant literature regarding PTSD in women to highlight the importance of considering gender and sex as risk and resilience factors. The chapter is organized according to reproductive stage, as PTSD symptoms and treatment implications vary across the female lifespan."

The CCPTSD group demonstrated significantly higher levels of physical aggression and self‐harm than the PTSD group. The complex PTSD symptom of ‘alterations in self‐perception’ was a significant predictor of aggression and history of self‐harm, suggesting the potential role of posttraumatic shame and self‐loathing in PTSD theoretical models of these destructive behaviors.

TMS was applied at three intensities: 90, 100, and 110% of subjects' motor threshold (MT). The TMS‐compatible neuronavigation system guaranteed precise repositioning of the stimulation coil. The responses were recorded by a 60‐channel whole head TMS‐compatible EEG amplifier.

Those differences have been attributed to the activation of specific neural populations. However, up to date, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is still missing since studies were mostly based on indirect measures of cortical activation, i.e., motor evoked potentials or phosphenes. Here, we investigated for the first time the impact of different coil orientations and waveforms on a non-primary cortical area, namely the premotor cortex, by measuring TMS evoked EEG potentials (TEPs). We aimed at determining whether TEPs produced by differently oriented biphasic and monophasic TMS pulses diverge and whether these differences are underpinned by the activation of specific neural populations. To do so, we applied TMS over the right premotor cortex with monophasic or biphasic waveforms oriented perpendicularly (in the anterior-posterior direction and vice-versa) or parallel (latero-medial or medio-laterally) to the target gyrus. EEG was concurrently recorded from 60 electrodes. We analyzed TEPs at the level of EEG sensors and cortical sources both in time and time-frequency domain. Biphasic pulses evoked larger early TEP components, which reflect cortical excitability properties of the underlying cortex, in both parallel directions when compared to the perpendicular conditions. Conversely, monophasic pulses, when oriented perpendicularly to the stimulated gyrus, elicited a greater N100, which is a reliable TEP component linked to GABAb-mediated inhibitory processes, than when parallel to the gyrus. Our results provide direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that TMS pulse waveform and TMS coil orientations affect which neural population is engaged."

        "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in humans induces electric fields (E-fields, EF) that perturb and modulate the brain’s endogenous neuronal activity and result in the generation of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). The exact relation of the characteristics of the induced E-field and the intensity of the brains’ response, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), is presently unclear. In this pilot study, conducted on three healthy subjects and two patients with generalized epilepsy (total: 3 males, 2 females, mean age of 26 years; healthy: 2 males, 1 female, mean age of 25.7 years; patients: 1 male, 1 female, mean age of 26.5 years), we investigated the temporal and spatial relations of the E-field, induced by single-pulse stimuli, and the brain’s response to TMS. Brain stimulation was performed with a deep TMS device (BrainsWay Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel) and an H7 coil placed over the central area. The induced EF was computed on personalized anatomical models of the subjects through magneto quasi-static simulations. We identified specific time instances and brain regions that exhibit high positive or negative associations of the E-field with brain activity. In addition, we identified significant correlations of the brain’s response intensity with the strength of the induced E-field and finally prove that TEPs are better correlated with E-field characteristics than with the stimulator’s output. These observations provide further insight in the relation between E-field and the ensuing cortical activation, validate in a clinically relevant manner the results of E-field modeling and reinforce the view that personalized approaches should be adopted in the field of non-invasive brain stimulation."

In some cases the results confirm previous work on animals, which means that the same measures can be used to investigate the pathophysiology in human neurological disease. However, many results reveal new information that had not previously been described in experiments on animals. Therefore, it is not wrong to say that TMS measures can be used to describe in humans what has already been described in animals; they can become drivers of new concepts as well."

Compared with the conventional electrical stimulation, it has so many advantages that it seems very likely to become an important tool in doing research into brain function; moreover, with the development of this technique, its applications of in clinical medicine is more and more appreciated. This paper emphasizes the basic principle and applications of tanscranial magnetic stimulation."

Veterans demonstrated significant reductions in total PTSD symptoms from pre‐ to posttreatment. Returning veterans from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq and other era veterans (Vietnam Veterans and military sexual trauma veterans) demonstrated significant reductions in PTSD. In addition, veterans demonstrated significant reductions in depression from pre‐ to posttreatment. In conclusion, PE is effective in reducing the symptoms of PTSD in veterans."

We first introduce methods to measure corticospinal excitability, intracortical inhibitory and facilitatory circuits and cortico-cortical connections. We then discuss the use of TMS in several neurological disorders. Central motor conduction time (CMCT) can be used to detect myelopathy and to localize the lesions, while the triple stimulation technique has higher sensitivity. CMCT can also detect upper motor neuron involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. The ipsilateral silent period and CMCT are helpful for differentiating atypical parkinsonism from Parkinson’s disease. Distinct patterns of cortical excitability findings can be obtained from different genetic forms of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia. Reduction of short afferent inhibition (SAI) in Alzheimer disease and reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in fronto-temporal dementia can be reliable indicators to differentiate these two diseases. Patients with diffuse Lewy body dementia and hallucination also have reduced SAI. The results of motor evoked potential measurements in the early stage of stroke are predictive of the long-term motor outcome. SICI, CMCT, and rest motor threshold are useful measurements to monitor extent of clinical disability. We conclude that TMS has clinical diagnostic utility in a broad range of neurological diseases."

We co-registered EEG and applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to the left posterolateral cerebellum and an extra-cerebellar control region (vertex) while healthy adult volunteers performed a Go/Nogo Flanker Task. In Go trials, TMS pulses were applied at four different time points, with temporal shifts of -100 ms, -50 ms, 0 ms, or +50 ms relative to the individual error latency (IEL, i.e., individual ERN peak latency + median error response time). These stimulation timings were aggregated into early (-100 ms, -50 ms) and late (0 ms, +50 ms) stimulation for the analysis. In Nogo trials, TMS pulses occurred 0 ms, 100 ms, or 300 ms after stimulus onset. Mixed linear model analyses revealed that cerebellar stimulation did not affect error rates overall. No effects were found for response times. As hypothesized, ERN amplitudes were decreased for cerebellar stimulation. No significant differences were found for the error positivity (Pe). Similar to TMS application to probe cerebellar-brain inhibition in the motor domain, the inhibitory tone of the cerebellar cortex may have been disrupted by the pulses. Reduced inhibitory output of the cerebellar cortex may have facilitated the processing of error information for response selection, which is reflected in a decreased ERN."

        "abstract": "In the human brain, aging is characterized by progressive neuronal loss, leading to disruption of synapses and to a degree of failure in neurotransmission. However, there is increasing evidence to support the notion that the aged brain has a remarkable ability to reorganize itself, with the aim of preserving its physiological activity. It is important to develop objective markers able to characterize the biological processes underlying brain aging in the intact human, and to distinguish them from brain degeneration associated with many neurological diseases. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), coupled with electromyography or electroencephalography (EEG), is particularly suited to this aim, due to the functional nature of the information provided, and thanks to the ease with which it can be integrated with behavioral manipulation. In this review, we aimed to provide up to date information about the role of TMS and TMS-EEG in the investigation of brain aging. In particular, we focused on data about cortical excitability, connectivity and plasticity, obtained by using readouts such as motor evoked potentials and transcranial evoked potentials. Overall, findings in the literature support an important potential contribution of TMS to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying normal brain aging. Further studies are needed to expand the current body of information and to assess the applicability of TMS findings in the clinical setting."

        "abstract": "itle>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Recent studies using combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) have shown that pain leads to an increase in the N45 peak of the TMS-evoked potential (TEP), potentially linked to changes in GABAergic activity. Conversely, 10 Hz repetitive TMS (10 Hz-rTMS), which provides pain relief, reduces the N45 peak. However, these studies used brief pain stimuli (lasting minutes), limiting their clinical relevance. The present study determined the effect of pain and 10 Hz-rTMS on the N45 peak in a prolonged pain model (lasting several days) induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) injection to the elbow muscle. In Experiment 1, TEPs were measured in 22 healthy participants on Day 0 (pre-NGF), Day 2 (peak pain), and Day 7 (pain recovery). In Experiment 2, we examined the effect of 5 days of active (n = 16) or sham (n = 16) rTMS to the left primary motor cortex (M1) on the N45 peak during prolonged NGF-induced pain, with TEPs measured on Day 0 and Day 4 (post-rTMS). Peak pain and muscle soreness was mild to moderate across experiments. In Experiment 1, there was no evidence for an increase in the N45 peak during prolonged pain. Exploratory analyses revealed evidence for a reduction in the N45 peak from Day 2 to 7, and a correlation between higher pain severity on Day 2 and a larger increase in the N45 peak. In Experiment 2, active rTMS reduced the N45 peak on Day 4 versus Day 0, with no effect in the sham group. Overall, our study showed that during prolonged pain, 5 days of 10 Hz rTMS induces a reduction in the TEP N45 peak. However, contrary to previous studies, prolonged pain itself did not increase the N45 peak. Taken together, this study provides weaker evidence for a link between the N45 peak and pain perception compared to previous research. Nonetheless, exploratory findings—such as a reduction in the N45 peak during the pain recovery phase and an individual-level relationship between increases in N45 and pain severity—suggest that further studies with larger sample sizes and more robust pain models are needed to clarify this connection."

The distributed cortical response can be recorded with electroencephalography (EEG). Since TMS also stimulates peripheral sensory and motor axons and generates a loud “click” sound, the TMS-evoked EEG potential (TEP) not only reflects neural activity induced by transcranial neuronal excitation but also neural activity reflecting somatosensory and auditory processing. In 17 healthy young individuals, we systematically assessed the contribution of multisensory peripheral stimulation to TEPs using a TMS-compatible EEG system. Real TMS was delivered with a figure-of-eight coil over the left para-median posterior parietal cortex or superior frontal gyrus with the coil being oriented perpendicularly or in parallel to the target gyrus. We also recorded the EEG responses evoked by sham stimulation over the posterior parietal and superior frontal cortex, mimicking the auditory and somatosensory sensations evoked by real TMS. We applied state-of-the-art procedures to attenuate somatosensory and auditory confounds during real TMS, including the placement of a foam layer underneath the coil and auditory noise masking. Despite these precautions, the temporal and spatial features of the cortical potentials evoked by real TMS at the prefrontal and parietal site closely resembled the cortical potentials evoked by realistic sham TMS, both for early and late TEP components. Our findings stress the need to include a peripheral multisensory control stimulation in the study design to enable a dissociation between truly transcranial and non-transcranial components of TEPs."

Existing approaches are limited to scalp heuristics or depend on some combination of neuronavigation hardware, average brain templates, as well as subject MRI and/or evoked responses. We developed head-model guided TMS virtual neuronavigation without subject MRI, specialized hardware, or evoked responses. The MRI-free virtual neuronavigation involves three scalp measurements which are then used to generate an individualized head model by applying ellipsoid-based affine transformations to the MNI standard head model. Virtual neuronavigation is then performed on this individualized head model for any brain target. The coil position is then provided to the operator in simple geodesic measurements. We simulated this process on MRI data of fifteen subjects showing a mean error of 2.75 mm, outperforming the accuracy of scalp heuristic targeting approaches."

This chapter concentrates on the role of single and paired pulse TMS methods that have been covered in detail in previous chapters. Long lasting effects of repetitive TMS (rTMS) are described in later chapters. Almost all of the TMS measures described in previous chapters differ in subjects at rest and during tonic voluntary activity."

Here, we explore the potential of electric field (e-field) based TMS dosing to reduce its variability and discuss current challenges as well as future pathways. In contrast to previous dosing approaches, e-field dosing better matches the stimulation strength across cortical areas, both within and across individuals. Challenges include methodological uncertainties of the e-field simulation, target definitions, and comparability of different stimulation thresholds across cortical areas and NIBS protocols. Despite these challenges, e-field dosing promises to substantially improve NIBS applications in neuroscientific research and personalized medicine.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Outstanding Questions Box</jats:title><jats:boxed-text id=\"bx1\" position=\"float\" orientation=\"portrait\"><jats:p>Outstanding Questions<jats:list list-type=\"bullet\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>Does the cortical threshold for effective stimulation differ between primary regions and higher-level association areas?

Cortical reorganization or plasticity includes modification of synaptic efficacy as well as neuronal networks that carry behavioural implications. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allows for the study of primary motor cortex reorganization in humans. Motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes change in response to practice. This article gives information about the effect of practice on TMS measures such as motor-evoked potential amplitudes, motor maps, paired-pulse measures, and behavioural measures. These changes may be accompanied by down-regulation of activity in nearby body part representations within the same hemisphere and in homonymous regions of the opposite hemisphere, mediated by interhemispheric interactions. There is evidence pointing towards the influence of practice on a distributed network of cortical representations within regions of cerebral hemispheres. This has lead to the formulation of intervention strategies to enhance the training effects by cortical or somatosensory stimulation in health and disease."

We discuss the major research and clinical applications of TMS–EEG and review synthetic measures designed to assess the functional status of cortical networks, such as neuronal excitability and effective connectivity. We first highlight that brain reactivity to TMS crucially depends on the anatomical and functional characteristics of the cortical region being stimulated. These findings suggest that the responses to stimulation of the primary motor cortex should be considered a special rather than a representative case of the brain’s reaction to TMS. Next, we describe TMS–EEG-based measures of (i) cortical reactivity in the time and frequency domains, (ii) excitation and inhibition provided by paired-pulse paradigms, and (iii) neuroplasticity induced by non-invasive neuromodulatory interventions. Finally, we discuss the methodological challenges related to concurrent TMS–EEG and review methods for minimizing/suppressing artifacts that may contaminate brain signals. We conclude that TMS–EEG has great potential for becoming an effective research and clinical tool, provided that: 1) data quality is monitored in real time; 2) effective and sound artifact-removal methods are developed and implemented; and 3) sufficient control studies are performed to assess the impact of TMS on the cortex."

Here, we explore the potential of electric field (e-field) based TMS dosing to reduce its variability and discuss current challenges as well as future pathways. In contrast to previous dosing approaches, e-field dosing better matches the stimulation strength across cortical areas, both within and across individuals. Challenges include methodological uncertainties of the e-field simulation, target definitions, and comparability of different stimulation thresholds across cortical areas and NIBS protocols. Despite these challenges, e-field dosing promises to substantially improve NIBS applications in neuroscientific research and personalized medicine.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Outstanding Questions Box</jats:title><jats:boxed-text id=\"bx1\" position=\"float\" orientation=\"portrait\"><jats:p>Outstanding Questions<jats:list list-type=\"bullet\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>Does the cortical threshold for effective stimulation differ between primary regions and higher-level association areas?

The objective of the present study was to determine whether state‐dependency can reveal letter selectivity in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a region known to contain letter‐selective neurons. In two experiments, we used visual priming and adaptation to modulate the initial activation state of the left PPC prior to application of TMS. In the priming experiment, TMS was applied over the left PPC during the delay between the prime and the target stimulus on each experimental trial. Left PPC TMS reversed the effects of priming by facilitating the detection of non‐primed letters, whereas detection of primed letters was unaffected. As neurons tuned to non‐primed letters were less active at the time of TMS application than neurons tuned to the primed letters, this finding demonstrates that TMS preferentially facilitates the detection of attributes encoded by the less active neural populations. A similar facilitation of the less active neural populations was observed when adaptation was used to suppress letter‐selective neurons prior to application of TMS. Our study demonstrates that TMS‐priming and TMS‐adaptation paradigms can reveal letter selectivity in the left PPC and thus be useful in the study of language processes. Our results also show that the state‐dependent TMS effects obtained with visual priming are similar to those found with TMS adaptation: in both cases, attributes encoded by the less active neural populations are preferentially facilitated."

Although exposure-based therapies are efficacious, not all patients respond adequately to treatment. In some cases, behavioral therapies have been associated with high refusal and attrition rates. Furthermore, evidence-based behavioral interventions are not yet widely available, because relatively few practitioners are trained adequately outside of academic institutions, and there are few trained professionals outside of urban centers. Even when evidence-based behavioral or pharmacological treatments are available, veterans sometimes avoid seeking these treatments because of perceived stigma about receiving traditional forms of mental health care either from traditional mental health care providers or in traditional mental health care environments. Despite large numbers of returning veterans being diagnosed with PTSD since the start of the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, there remains a large number of Americans who have limited access to evidence-based interventions for PTSD. Although efforts to expand access to these treatments should continue, there should also be an effort to investigate novel interventions for PTSD—particularly those that may require less training and/or may be associated with less stigma than conventional treatments."

The chapter propose that associations and increased odds ratios associated with PTSD and dementia, while worthy of study, do not firmly establish a causative relationship between PTSD and dementia. The barriers to studying the associations between PTSD and dementia as they relate to causal mechanisms are also examined. Further research is needed, with more precise definitions, diagnostic rigor, and a focus on examining actual brain–behavior mechanisms that may shed light on potential causation."

More recently, an association between exposure to stressful life events and the development of later‐life cognitive dysfunction has been proposed. Several plausible neurohormonal pathways and genetic mechanisms exist to support such an association. However, many logistical and methodological barriers must be overcome before a defined causal linkage can be firmly established. Here the authors review recent studies of the long‐term cognitive consequences of exposures to cumulative ordinary life stressors as well as extraordinary traumatic events leading to posttraumatic stress disorder. Suggestive effects have been demonstrated for the role of life stress in general, and posttraumatic stress disorder in particular, on a range of negative cognitive outcomes, including worse than normal changes with aging, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. However, given the magnitude of the issue, well‐controlled studies are relatively few in number, and the effects they have revealed are modest in size. Moreover, the effects have typically only been demonstrated on a selective subset of measures and outcomes. Potentially confounding factors abound and complicate causal relationships despite efforts to contain them. More well‐controlled, carefully executed longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the apparent association between stress and dementia, clarify causal relationships, develop reliable antemortem markers, and delineate distinct patterns of risk in subsets of individuals.</jats:p></jats:sec"

Tant pour l’ergonomie francophone que pour la perspective Clinique de l’activité en psychologie du travail, le défi méthodologique d’une intervention en milieu de travail consiste à créer les conditions d’expression et d’examen de ressources pour développer des actions favorables à la santé. Dans un cadre approprié, lorsque les gestes ordinaires au travail peuvent être transformés en « gestes dialogués » grâce à des débats professionnels au sein d’un collectif de pairs et plus largement entre décideurs et managers, alors des alternatives de transformations possibles émergent. Notre proposition est basée sur une recherche dans le métier de fossoyeur sur l’activité de démolition de pierres tombales. Cette intervention nous permet de suggérer que le « geste dialogué » est un instrument psychosocial et psychomoteur qui favorise le développement du geste de métier et sa formation pour la prévention des TMS. Le développement potentiel des gestes de métier nécessite de s’interroger sur les liens entre l’engagement du corps dans l’activité, les problèmes organisationnels à résoudre et la santé au travail."

In particular, higher brain functions depend on brain regions and neural circuits that evolved differently between primates and rodents. Thus, NHPs are a strong translational model system to investigate the pathophysiology and relevant biological correlates of mental disorders. This talk will focus on translational approaches leveraging NHP models to advance our understanding of environmentally induced epigenetic changes in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Environmental factors including early life stress significantly contribute to risk and resilience for psychiatric disorders including PTSD. However, human studies are often confounded, and it remains challenging to identify robust epigenetic signals in clinical populations even in large studies. We investigate the natural spectrum of behavioral phenotypes in rhesus macaques to complement human studies with a focus on stress and fear. This talk will present data on epigenetic signatures of fear and the effects of early life stress in rhesus monkeys and their relationship to human studies.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"S0924933821001206_sec132\"><jats:title>Disclosure</jats:title><jats:p>No significant relationships.</jats:p></jats:sec"

The advent of neuroimaging tools and the continued exponential growth and sophistication of the methods are key factors underlying advances in the field. In this chapter, informed by neuroimaging tools and basic neuroscience, the authors paint an optimistic canvas to illustrate the current state of knowledge pertaining to the etiology and pathophysiology of PTSD. The chapter describes the state of some recent developments and what is coming on the horizon in terms of novel approaches that may be applied toward the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD."

        "abstract": "In the brain, information from all the senses interacts and is integrated in order to create a unified sensory percept. Some percepts appear unimodal, and some, cross modal. Unimodal percepts can be modified by crossmodal interactions given that our brains process multiple streams of sensory information in parallel and promote extensive interactions. TMS can provide valuable insights on the neural substrates associated with multisensory processing in humans. TMS is commonly described as a ‘relatively painless’ method of stimulating the brain noninvasively. However, TMS itself is strong multisensory and this should be considered while interpreting the results. With regard to the crossmodal sensory changes that follow sensory deprivation, these changes can be revealed using a variety of methods including the combination of TMS with neuroimaging."

Here, we explore the potential of electric field (e-field) based TMS dosing to reduce its variability and discuss current challenges as well as future pathways. In contrast to previous dosing approaches, e-field dosing better matches the stimulation strength across cortical areas, both within and across individuals. Challenges include methodological uncertainties of the e-field simulation, target definitions, and comparability of different stimulation thresholds across cortical areas and NIBS protocols. Despite these challenges, e-field dosing promises to substantially improve NIBS applications in neuroscientific research and personalized medicine."
